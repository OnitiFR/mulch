- BUGFIX: investigate the very annoying and rare mulch-proxy children-parent lockup /!\
  - try to create a repro, see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36026 for template
  - have a deeper look at net/http/transport.go settings (proxy.go RoundTrip() func)
  - see if we can debug low-level inter-proxies HTTP2 connections (ex: connection "age")
  - test with HTTP inter-proxies exchanges instead of HTTPS (will probably fallback to HTTP/1.1)
  - get newly implemented SIGQUIT dump during outage (done, front & m0)
  - look if we see 200 returns on 0 duing outage (OK)
  - test direct child proxy access during outage (OK!)
  - test other child proxy access during outage (OK!)
  - test with newer Go releases (current: 1.10.4) (OK! failure with 1.13.6)
  - lower IdleTimeout to see if it's of any effect
  - check for system limits (grep Threads /proc/$(pidof mulch-proxy)/status, done: far from limits, even during outage)
  - run DoS-like benchmarks (done: OK with up to 8k simultaneous requests)
- use of /tmp/mulch-proxy-xxx for dumps is not secure
- switch default SSH user to app instead of admin (update client sshconfig.go doc)
- add timeout on VM creation scripts OR at least allow VM deletion
- add/check server timeouts when client disapears on do action (ex: kill -9 on "mulch do xx logs")
- proxy-chain: provide a way to clean old childs? (ex: proxy_chain_child_url have changed)
- proxy / proxy-chain request stats?
- check domains validity on VM create, PS: domain name validation is HARD :(
- "hanging" operations (ex: mulch do xyz log + vm rebuild)
- test "pre-allocated" backup disks on backup duration for "big VMs"?
- check TLS cert renewal!
  - reported issue: vm is deleted, recreated 3 months later, cert is invalid
  - Go changed the way cert are stored?
  - can't reproduce
- add a SSH keepalive for Run.SSHConn?
- write API public documentation
- continue tests on snapshots (see branch "snapshots")
- investigate why we seem to lose contact with (some) VMs when killing/restarting libvirtd
  - (dhcp/dnsmasq? ebtables? mulch-network restart?)
- libvirtd watchdog + alert (ex: timeout in VMStateDatabase?)
- clean VM XML template (ex: no display device [serial console])
- create a nice and shiny website for Mulch project
- VM tags
- have a look at ansible? (for sample scripts)
- remove the need to supply the VM name for redefine command?
  - keep: sanity check for a dangerous op, but looks confusing to the user
  - remove: change controller logic
- shortcut for "do action" (ex: mulch open xyz) with completion ?
- add 'env' to mulchd.toml? (overridden by VM's env directive)
- flag for compression / no compression on "vm backup"
- rights / limited access (warning: logs may expose sensitive data)
- check for missing response.Body.Close() (or things like that)
- check for io.Reader bad usages ("they must record the number of bytes read into the buffer, reslice the buffer, process that data, and only then, consult the error." https://dave.cheney.net/2019/09/05/dont-force-allocations-on-the-callers-of-your-api)

- change HTTP code from 200 to 4XX in controllers when things fails (ex: req.Stream.Failure)
  - in client, make the non-200 error message silent in stream mode?

- check connection and access rights
- differentiate "rights issues" from "libvirtd not running" issues
- check 'nwfilter-dumpxml clean-traffic' / libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter during install?

- mulchd should be able to run with a remote libvirtd (StoragePath disallow this, currently)
- support passphrase for Mulch SSH key?
- move SSH Keys and MulchSuperUser to VM level?
- challenge based auth?
