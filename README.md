# Mulch
Easy VM creation and management tool: velvet applications in an iron hypervisor

What is it?
---
Mulch is a light and practical virtual machine manager, it allows to create VMs and host applications in VM with a single command line and a simple description file. **You can see it as a simple KVM hardened container system**.

It's using libvirt API (KVM) and can share an existing libvirt server or use a
dedicated one. It features a client-server architecture using
a REST API. It's written in Go and use shell scripts to drive VM configuration and application installation. Base Linux images ("seeds") use Cloud-Init so almost every [OpenStack compliant image](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html) will work out of the box. Default Mulch configuration provides seeds for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

It features an embedded high-performance HTTP / HTTP2 reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt certificate generation for VM hosted Web Application.

Mulh also provides an SSH proxy providing full access (ssh, scp, port forwarding, …) to VMs for Mulch users.

Here is a minimal VM description file: (TOML format)
```toml
# This is a (working) minimalist sample VM definition
name = "mini"
seed = "debian_9"

disk_size = "20G"
ram_size = "1G"
cpu_count = 1
```
You can then create this VM with:
```sh
mulch vm create mini.toml
```

How do I install the client?
---
Usual Go requirements : check you have go/golang installed and `~/go/bin/` is in your `PATH` (or copy binary in one of your `PATH` directories).

Then install the client:
```sh
go get -u github.com/Xfennec/mulch/cmd/mulch
```

That's it, you can now run `mulch` command. It will show you a sample configuration file (`~/.mulch.toml`):
```toml
[[server]]
name = "my-mulch"
url = "http://192.168.10.104:8585"
key = "gein2xah7keeL33thpe9ahvaegF15TUL3surae3Chue4riokooJ5WuTI80FTWfz2"
```
Of course, you'll need to get your own API key / server URL.

How do I install the server? (mulchd and mulch-proxy)

Install:
 - libvirt daemon packages: libvirt-bin / libvirt(?)
 - development packages: libvirt-dev / libvirt-devel package needed
 - go get -u github.com/Xfennec/mulch/cmd/...
 - cd go/src/github.com/Xfennec/mulch
 - ./install.sh
